### Currently Abandoned :(
The [screen](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5793) fits well enough in the miata gauge cluster with some cutting.  
However, it does not have internal GRAM and the [controller](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5800) simply does not have the memory size and processing power to drive the screen and refresh at the speed I need.  
  
I may perhaps use this for something simpler but for a real digital dash I think a Raspberry Pi and a display that comes with an HDMI driver is a much better choice for this project.
